Things I need to create a quiz app:

Programmatic Proof of Concept:

1. Question-Answer Bank
a. This should map questions to answers and topics
b. This should ideally separate questions by topics
c. This should be persistent data somewhere

2. Question Generator:
a. This should randomly generate a question from the Question-Answer Bank 
b. This should give you four choices from the answers in the Question-Answer Bank 
-- One of these answers will be the correct one according to the Question-Answer Bank 
-- The others will be random 
-- These will be randomly mapped to 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D'
-- Each will be mapped as a tuple (A, [answer], right/wrong)

3. Quiz Generator: 
a. This will call the Question Generator and:
-- Ask you a question
-- Give you 4 choices 
-- Allow for answer input
-- Tell you if the answer is right or wrong
-- Tell you the correct answer.

 


End Product:
1. Web Form to add questions and answers
2. Web form to edit questions and answers
3. Different kinds of questions
4. A page that tells you what you got right and wrong
5. Score Count
6. User Accounts
7. Design
